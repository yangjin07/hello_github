# My Plan
write a framework for gui programming
split the gui part with the callback functions

I got the idea from EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System).
EPICS is transfer actions through ethernet. So I try to use gui client to send
control messages, and use callback clients for response when they receive the 
control messages.

# These Weeks start from small socket example
I'm not quite familiar with socket programming. Learn, then do.
